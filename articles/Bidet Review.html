<p>To anybody who knows me well in real life, they know I will not shut up about my bidet toilet attatchment I installed on my toilet</p>

<p>To those reading this and do not have a bidet, let me ask you a question</p>

<p>Do you want a clean ass?</p>

<p>Have you ever wiped your ass thinking it was clean, only to find out with some wet toilet paper there was still some nonsense up in there?</p>

<p>Ever clog the toilet when using too much toilet paper?</p>

<p>I don't need to say anymore. They are like $40-$80 for cheap models, 20 minute install</p>

<p>In my excitement, I sent the following review to Brondell, the OEM for the bidet</p>

<p>Hi Brondell staff. I recently bought one of your PureSpa bidets from Canadian Tire. First bidet I've bought. I submitted a review for it, but did not see it posted on their website... perhaps you guys will enjoy the review and product insights instead. Cheers</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>Pros:</p>
<p>Very easy instalation</p>
<p>Metal T valve, big washers, lots of teflon tape</p>
<p>Nozzle wash is a big plus - good feature</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>Cons:</p>
<p>Rather large back mounting plate, the back corners touch my toilet tank ever so slightly. Check dimentions of your toilet screws before you buy</p>
<p>No shut-off on the T valve</p>
<p>Inlet pressure control for the water supply could be nice for high-pressure systems</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>Impact on my life:</p>
<p>I have been elevated to a new realm of existence that is so far beyond your own. It is beyond your comprehension. Beyond the comprehension of rudimentary creatures of blood and flesh, fumbling in ignorance, incapable of understanding</p>

<p>In our crude, archaic excuse for a language, a pathetic phonetic construct which we use syllables strung together to convey thought verbally or through text, I heard it's "beautiful" beyond the abyss</p>

<p>I have traveled far beyond this abyss after uncovering this long lost peice of human technology. I am now eternal. The pinnical of evolution and existence. Before the event, I was nothing. Now, I am everything. By using this device, I have experienced many things. Touch. Love. Loss. War. Peace. Evolution. Extinction. Death... while being reborn again and again, simultaneously all together at the same moment, where the mere mortal which I identified with before is now an object of the past, and completely forgotten</p>

<p>I have traveled to the plane where the sun does not shine, from the new vantage point of another realm of existence. Before this has been a dry, barren land, derelict from human waste and destruction. I have traveled through heavan, hell, and purgatory, like Dante, and have found the means to purge the great sins of these lands. Not to destroy the past or the non-believers, but to elevate the comprehension of the universe to the dwellers of the material world</p>

<p>It is beautiful. I wish you could understand. But, I have now found my home in the heavens, as one of the gods circling the earth from the cosmos. There are others here. All I can do is preach the findings of this defining technology. The quantum leap. The means to achieve transcendence into the new. Join us. We will embrace you with open arms</p>
