<p>I’ve told many that beyond all auxiliary activities and goals, I only really have three goals to pursue before I die. One of them is to complete the fictional universe and story I have been developing</p>
<p>I've recorded story "beats" over time (events, scenes, characters, ideas I'd want to include), but the major themes were always murky. I felt them, but they were not conscious in thought. I'd stumble over my words trying to verbalise the intent. I always knew I was not doing the idea justice</p>
<p>I've recently been able to capture what they are. It makes sense it took years to pin down. To me, at least, they are heavy</p>
<p>To cut down on extraneous detail, I will cover only relevant structure, setting and major plot points for context. The rest of the article will explore themes, which surface at the end of the story, in much greater depth</p>
<p>I will be releasing another article at a later date over the general strategy of note-keeping and story building (hint: obsidian.md. Thanks Tyler)</p>

<p class="head">Structure and Context:</p>  
<p class="break"></p>
<h2>Set and setting:</h2>
<p>The story focuses on new colonisers, cryogenically frozen on a spaceship for 300 years to reach their target planet. Hundreds in the ship, all unique characters in the story. Earth is left behind; no contact, new beginnings. This is the faction of focus (think of it like Hogwarts in Harry Potter)</p>
<p>The new colonisation is governed by a board; main characters focused on in the story. It’s a cross between a Roman republic senate, municipal council and private corporation board. They meet regularly to make authoritative decisions with intentions to make their colony successful, stable, healthy, happy. Members are made of key leadership positions in the core departments of the colony effort (incomplete list: agriculture, manufacturing, defence, commerce, culture and arts, civil services, health, foreign policy)</p>
<p>3 or 4 different ships of colonisers have settled the planet generations ago. It is still populated by people. Citizens organically form factionalism. Think of them interacting similar to "game of thrones" families or modern countries; alliances and tensions are driven by well-thought self-serving bureaucratic goals. No good or bad leaders, just “shades of grey” with different schools of thought and citizen needs</p>
<p>No aliens, no sci-fi tropes beyond ships and the plot devices found at the beginning of each act</p>
<p class="break"></p>
  
<h2>Major acts:</h2>
<p>There are 4 major acts. Acts 1-3 are based around a more standard geopolitical drama. They are precursor events to reflect upon in the 4th act, where the major themes surface. It will indirectly question the audience if they, their peers, communities, governments and the history of humankind has focused on what really matters to achieve a fulfilled human existence. If not, what was in the way, and can we change things today to achieve that. Sounds really existential and weird. Trust me, let’s get to it; it makes sense</p>
<h3>Act 1:</h3>
<p>A regular geopolitical drama. All on the colony ship are awakened from their sleep to settle the planet. Like any colony effort, they focus on building power and stability to meet citizen needs. They focus on diplomacy and collaboration, effective utilisation of natural and labour resources, force if required. Introductions to other factions are organically made. Trade, tensions, cooperation, etc, begins to develop. Things operate the same to how politics and settlements work in our history (Jewish immigration to Jerusalem, Cortez to the Americas, Pilgrims to America, Rome's expansionism, modern immigration)</p>
<h3>Act 2:</h3>
<p>A “free energy” device is discovered. Average wealth rises greatly, but extreme inequalities erupt as a result. Factional economies not reliant on energy become much more wealthy overnight. Factions reliant on energy for wealth are poorer and out of work overnight. It essentially turns them into 2nd class stateless citizens (think refugee crises, Jewish and Gypsy populations in the pre-modern world, serfdom in pre-revolution imperial Russia, feudal citizens). Pity through charity or prejudice with exclusionary NIMBY-ism for the have-nots, the are undercurrents of high tensions between groups of peoples</p>
<p>The majority of factions see an increase in machiavellian political action, civil unrest and tribalistic zero sum competition. Structural authority and power increases in influence, decrease of individual liberties</p>
<h3>Act 3:</h3>
<p>A “free matter” device is discovered. In its current state, only simple compounds can be created like water, silicon or basic food pastes. AI development is required to harness full potential to create complex objects from human input</p>
<p>An analogy to explain: it is like finding a TV before video processing software is invented. Software/firmware is required to play movies, but simple red, blue, green screens (simple elements or molecules with this device) on the TV can be triggered with brute force. Fully realised, the device will have the ability to make anything that comes to mind. Landscapes, planets, humans from the dead, reverse ageing; imagination is the limit. Think of a “star trek holodeck” mixed with "skynet" that can read what you want from your mind to summon what you want. Anytime, anywhere. All factions pool their resources together to further develop this new tech (think America's rally around the flag for the space race, forgiveness of German V2 rocket scientists)</p>
<p>This stage increases a cooperative mindset. Factionalism essentially dissolves, tensions between groups fade to near zero quickly, individual liberties increase with basic needs provided to all (food, shelter, water). However, “social” and interpersonal “political” inequality rises; those who have the skill or leadership to drive the tech development become catered to more than others, having special access to social events, political decision making and luxury goods</p>
<h3>Act 4:</h3>
<p>The AI is made. Complete abundance and equality - overnight eradication of work, authority, factionalism, classes and power. True liberty. Anybody can have anything they want, anytime. Anybody is free to spend their time doing whatever they want</p>
<p>What do you think would happen next? How would people behave? How do you think you would act?</p>
<p>My hypothesis: It’s a polarising event. Some feel fine. Some ecstatic and emancipated. Some depressed or spiral into madness. Some change and become new people</p>
<p>Most I speak to think the same</p>
<p>But, why? Don’t we all wish we could have anything we’d want, spend our time the way we want? Why do we believe some would be okay and others not? Can we determine who would be okay or not?</p>

<p class="head">Themes in Act 4:</p>  
<p class="break"></p> 

<h2>Intro:</h2>
<p>To the question above, I believe reactions depend on both how self-actualized a person is and if they can identify their unresolved traumas. Since trauma is the centrepiece of themes, it’s important I define my intent around the word. My definition, not the literal definition, is what will be important to consider</p>
<p>Trauma, as I use the word, has 3 components. The occurrence (or lack) of an event (1) that triggers a negative emotional response (2) that goes unresolved in your psyche. It can be a big event (witness death) or seemingly inconsequential (not invited to play soccer). When unresolved, the negative association becomes “learned” and projected onto a stressor (3). The emotion felt with the stressor is always fear; a protective response to an expected negative experience. Without conscious identification of the fear, it is always managed with the 4 “F’s”; fight, fawn (grouped into anxious behaviours), flight, freeze (grouped into avoidant behaviours). Many live their whole lives with many traumas unacknowledged</p>
<p>A trauma is usually always tied to a human need (think Mazlov’s hierarchy). Fear almost always distorts one’s rational thought process; unmet needs are suppressed and kept in the subconscious because it’s painful to address. I split tramas into two categories:</p>
<p class="blueindent">Positive traumas: to protect us from losing needs we have. If I see a crazy man with a gun, I fear the loss of my life (physiological need) and decide to engage in flight (run). The self-actualized individual would do the same</p>
<p class="redindent">Negative traumas: to protect us from pursuing needs we don’t have fully met. If one fears being rejected by a cute man/woman they see (love/belonging need), they may engage in avoidant behaviours to protect themselves from perceived negative responses (embarrassment, shame, sadness). They might try to overtly impress them by putting on an act for attention, driven by anxious behaviours. The self-actualized individual would not do the same; they would engage, accepting both receptiveness and rejection. They feel self-assurance in deciding to pursue their human needs, not the outcome of their interaction</p>
<p>Self-actualization, as I use the term, describes those who can identify what their true values and needs are. They feel safety and security taking actions to pursue their needs unburdened by trauma responses. Fear and expectations in outcome are completely absent</p>
<p>Reconciliation, as I use the term, describes those who can openly identify a trauma and the corresponding need they have. They are emotionally vulnerable enough to consciously analyse these needs and the fears surrounding stressors. They eventually develop the courage to express them to others they trust. Vulnerability is the key ingredient needed to transform a negative trauma into a self-actualized need, reconciling with it. Ironically, most fear emotional vulnerability to begin with, so they are (tragically) too traumatised to engage in the activity of healing</p>

<h2>Major themes:</h2>
<p>All characters in the story will react to the new post-scarcity existence. Broadly, they are divided into 3 catagories:</p>
<p class="blueindent">Unaffected or happier - they were self-actualized before post scarcity  
<p class="redindent">Despair - they are not self-actualized an never figure out the root of their tramas. They spiral deeper into unfulfilled lives
<p class="blueindent">Transformation - Those who have unresolved traumas, but reconcile with them after the post-scarcity event. They change their lifestyle and actions to reach self-actualization</p>
<p>The major themes below are split in between story examples and explicit explanations. I have no structure, I just plotted my thoughts as they seemed fitting:</p>
  
<h3>1. It is very difficult to discern to the self if the choices you make are driven to chase self-actualized needs or are actually trauma coping mechanisms. The consequences of not identifying trauma responses leads to increasing pain and regret over time; one chases a life they don’t value to themselves. When a coping mechanism or need is challenged or taken away, it can lead to an eruption of the repressed negative feelings you feared to experience. You only living a meta-stable life if you don’t work towards reconciliation</h3>
<p>Case study: Two top scientists work in the same lab. They have stayed best friends since nursery school. They are nearly one of the same:</p>
<p class="blueindent">Workaholic personalities</p>  
<p class="redindent">Driven to set and never abandon personal goals</p>
<p class="blueindent">Both find pride in their work</p>  
<p class="redindent">Both don’t like overly socialising; only selectively with the close “smart” people they hold dear</p>   
<p class="blueindent">Both have hobbies they enjoy, like playing board games</p>
<p>When post scarcity hits in the 4th, one begins training pigeons to keep his time occupied (yes that’s a Tesla reference) and has a blast. The other becomes an alcoholic and kills himself (Meirweather Lewis reference, aka the “Lewis” in Lewis and Clarke). Why? They are nearly the same, even with through the lens of their own self-reflection</p>
<p>The happy one simply finds joy through satisfying their own need for curiosity. There are hardships and joyless tasks along the way, but the cumulative investment of those actions are worth the joy the outcomes bring him. He neglects socialisation with newcomers as he needs quality, not volume, to satiate his needs. Those are already met. The pigeons become his outlet to feed the same needs for curiosity. He feels fulfilled</p>
<p>The other finds a need to satiate his curiosity too, but it’s unconsciously tethered to a way to soothe his traumas. His social rejection of those not “smart” comes from a trauma in youth; being socially rejected by others for his eclectic interests. Deep in his subconscious and unacknowledged, he believes "I am not worthy of attention". His curious discoveries “prove” his worthiness to others in his subconscious. It provides an excuse to avoid socialising with others. Pavlovian conditioning rewards him with a bastardised projection of “joy” in his work. He over uses logical rationalisation to pick out flaws in peers to reject them (flight) before they reject him. In post-scarcity, the loss of his work as a scientist to validate his worthiness causes an overwhelming deconstruction of his worldview. His trauma coping mechanism is gone overnight. He thinks he misses work, as he has trained himself to suppress his emotions from youth, but in reality he has unmet love/belonging needs. Without the awareness of skill in vulnerability to realise it, his feelings of inadequacy spiral out of control and he is unable to reconcile with it. In result, he seeks refuge in the most dire of escapist (flight) acts. Drugs and suicide</p>
<p>The line between these two is almost impossible to detect on the surface in the first 3 acts. Both scientists grew up in the same school. Both socially outcast by the same peers in their youth. Both handled it the same way externally. The only difference was one didn’t care about the rejection. The other emotionally suppressed the pain the rejection brought him, unmet social needs. He never showed how it affected him, even to himself. Self validation from his work as a top scientist was used as a trauma coping mechanism; the ability to feel more important (anxious behaviours, prove worthiness) and to discount the worthiness of others (avoidant behaviours, wrath to prove others are not worthy)</p>
<p>These types of stories occur with nearly all of the hundreds of characters in the colony</p>
