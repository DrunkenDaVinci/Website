<p>I think I’m really onto something</p>
<p>I've been training in improv comedy for about a year now. Just for fun and to screw around with cool people, nothing more</p>
<p>One day I was thinking of characters ideas I could have in my "back pocket" that utilize my strengths and preferences well. It helps out when on stage</p>
<p>I thought of a few... but my mind kept coming back to an idea I had for a "positive masculinity coach". It's funny, but I don't think it was the funniest idea I had. Not by a longshot. But I had that "spidey sense" feeling about it. I felt “yo, something's up”</p>
<p>After reflecting, woah</p>
<p>Being the funniest idea or not is completely irrelevant. It's because, if implemented correctly through videos on the internet, it's a ridiculously overpowered concept from a growth hacking perspective. Not exaggerating. It's fishing with nuclear dynamite</p>
<p>I’ll briefly define the character, but the meat of this article is in the strategy</p>
<p>I PROMISE this does not lead to where you think it will lead. It has a clear end date. I will not be forever known as this character. I am not going to try to be a B-list comedian, a life coach hippie or other bullshit stuff. It’s extremely actionable. It’s very clever. It’s WILD</p>
<p>Hear me out</p>
<p class="head">What is this character</p>  
<p class="break"></p>
<p>The "positive masculinity coach". Final name TBD (needs to be distinguishable in search queries as per the plan). He's a character that talks to males with struggles guys experience differently. Think dating, loneliness, new fathers in female dominated parent groups, newlyweds</p>
<p>(Subject to change) He talks in an aggressive and overblown masculine tone. Think of an angry and brooding Terry Crews or Hulk Hogan. All skits will be filmed in different locations doing “guy stuff” to keep it novel and based in comedy (i.e, at the poker table, at the shooting range, running off the rugby field, after a Judo throw, after dive bar concert, suited in the boardroom, chopping wood, in a helicopter. Some require more effort for novelty, but most are VERY easy to do)</p>
<p>He makes references to "guy hobbies" a LOT (sports, cars, weight lifting, hunting, beer)</p>
<p>But all advice he gives is rock solid, never toxic, normal human advice to guys. No hint of sarcasm, he always treats women in a humanizing manner, understands their perspectives and problems, never objectifies or disrespects them. But also empathizes with men's true frustrations and never dismisses them... He just gives little "course corrections" when they come to unreasonable conclusions, and pumps them full of confidence they can tackle their struggles healthily</p>
<p>The juxtaposition between toxic context (setting, presentation) and healthy-viewpoint content (the script) is hilarious. At least I think so. Also, he will throw out hilariously overblown but genuine compliments to guys at the beginning of videos for comedic effect (but primarily, it’s just for magnificently deceptive marketing practices... You’ll see in step 4)</p>
<p>…hahaha, so funny, anyways... uhhh, why is this brilliant again drunkendavinci?</p>
<p>I SAID HEAR ME OUT</p>

<p>I think this concept is perfectly positioned to hack rapid growth through short videos in the Tik Tok and Instagram age. 0 followers to 100, 1000 to 10000+. All stages of growth</p>
<p>My plan is cheeky at best, Machiavellian at worst. It's a trojan horse to use toxic internet behavior for my benefit, but in a manner that’s genuinely non malicious to ANYONE. It's half the reason I find this loads fun</p>
<p>I’m secretly trolling on a transrational level until I reach step 10 in the plan</p>
<p>And by "perfectly positioned", I don't mean success is guaranteed, it might flop. But the probability of success is much higher and time/money investment is very low for similar class products (comedy video, social media content)</p>
<p>I realized this character kept popping in mind because of the online ecosystem it is within:</p>
<p class="break"></p>
<div class="redindent">
<p>[1] there is a lot of content on the internet focused on gender specific stuff. Men, women and dating </p>
<p>content = high volume, popular</p>
</div>
<div class="blueindent">
<p>advice from non-experts ("Stacey's dating tips for boys!!!") in this domain is wildly subjective and dodgy at best. Ranges from "OK, but overthinking it a bit" to flat out "toxic and/or delusional"</p>
<p>content = poor quality, casual and non professional</p>
</div>
<div class="redindent">
<p>[3] most viewers take the content way too literally ("you're a 7/10 looks, but being too beta. Stand with your shoulders straight"). Viewers commonly post comments with victimization of self or others frequently. High viewer engagement with flame wars or getting “triggered” </p>
<p>comments = high volume, lots of bad takes, emotional investment</p>
</div>
<div class="blueindent">
<p>[4] Most comments regularly converge into common themes. "All men are pigs, you don't need no man!" Or "girls ignore me because I'm ugly, I need to be jacked!"</p>
<p>comments = low diversity, repeated themes</p>
</div>
<p>-</p>
<p>This reliably predictable chaos is PERFECT for me to farm and engage with. It can be harnessed to grow a platform and viewership of my own content, with a hilarious end to the plan</p>
<p>My videos would start with posting an internet comment found in the wild, then ranting about it for 1 or 2 minutes in character</p>
<p>But the strategy behind growth and execution is the true secret sauce</p>
<h2>The Plan</h2>
<div class="redindent">
<p>[1] Spend time reading comments. Start a list of "common themes" men comment on. Ones that show genuine and real frustration but reach bad conclusions. Get a list of 30ish minimum</p>
<p>Take notes on profile picture traits with comments (beard, glasses, bald, etc). Store in easily sortable excel table</p>
</div>
<div class="blueindent">
<p>[2] Write scripts about each "common theme" on the list of them. Film them all. With low time/money investment, videos can be very high quality and entertaining (changing setting, outfits). Don't post any of them, create a backlog</p>
<p>Include an overblown complement joke based on extremely common traits seen in step 1. All scripts</p>
</div>
<div class="redindent">
<p>[3] Make 5 or 6 fake Instagram or Tik Tok accounts. Make the least frequent "common theme" comments on relevant channels</p>
<p)Make the main Instagram and Tik Tok account. Post 5 or 6 videos based on the comments I made on my fake accounts. Get friends to follow, just to establish 50-100 followers</p>
</div>
<div class="blueindent">
<p>[4] (Why this concept is unique)... Scale. Scan comment sections on channels I scouted in step 1. Find recent (<1 week) "common theme" comments by real people for one video topic at a time. Screenshot them. Try to find 100+ for each video. Really, 100+, each video</p>
<p>Message them all in a blitz. Include the relevant unreleased video in it WITH their screenshot added to it WITHOUT blurring out their name (super easy to do, takes 2 seconds in video editing software), ask them "hey, do you consent to me using your comment for my comedy skit? I made it based on your comment. Wish you the best buddy”</p>
<p>…In reality, I pre-made the video and I don't care about consent. I could just blank out names in comments, no foul play. It's just free, targeted, personalized advertising. Perfect</p>
<p>Adding their screenshot makes them think "he only messaged me, or maybe 1-2 others"</p>
<p>Each person messaged will have a profile picture matching the complement joke in each video (BRO, you're brown eyes are like DREAMY LITTLE CHOCOLATES I get lost in). It makes it seem like I totally targeted them for the video. In reality, I just base the jokes around the most common traits which were found in step 1 (I.e, I will never complement red hair)</p>
<p>It also guilts them to go to my channel it and strikes fear about posting their name publicly. like "oh, he put in all this effort about me? But what? My name publicly out there saying dodgy stuff? I need to double check!!!" Also if I’m ever asked, I throw out a white lie mentioning "ya, I messaged just a few others too". Don’t mention hundreds, lol</p>
<p>I genuinely sympathize with their struggles, but lonely men should have a high response rate. Maybe 10/100 become followers, 1/100 shares to his friends</p>
<p>Genius</p>
<p>Just pick one that accepts consent to publish the video a week later</p>
<p><i>(Note: I need to investigate this more, but figure out what platforms constitute as ban-able spam. But if this gets close to it, try to spread messages across platforms to avoid triggering detection (20 messages max for Tik Tok, reddit, instagram, youtube, discord groups. Each once a week), use different file names and screenshot for each video sent out.. not sure if that will bypass video hashing. If banned, link the main account from new accounts in messages, use a new fixed IP through SSH tunnelling each time. Lol. So cheeky)</i></p>
